    <h1>About This Website</h1>

    <p>
        I built this website as part of my journey into programming.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project is my first step into web development.
        I used Python and Flask to build a simple website where users can leave messages.
        The idea may be small, but it's completely mine â€” written, tested, and deployed by me.
        The most interesting part is that I learned all of these with ChatGPT, and I would like to say it is the best teacher.
    </p>

    <p>
        I plan to improve this site over time, adding features like a message board, chatbot responses, and even AI tools.
        For now, it's proof that even without a traditional school path, I can learn and build.
    </p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        Hi, I'm someone who left school in 8th grade and have been self-studying ever since.<br>
        I started learning Python because I wanted to create real things, not just follow tutorials.<br>
        My hobby is playing the guitar, travelling, and trying different kinds of food.<br>
        I used to live in Japan for 6 months just by myself, and I'm now living in Vancouver, BC alone as well.<br>
        I'm really proud of myself, cause I applied for the visa on my own, and it was successfully approved.<br>
        I was 17 when I wrote all of these. I hope you like this website.<br>
    </p>
