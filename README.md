Hi! I'm a self-taught developer who left school in 8th grade and started learning programming at home.  
This is the first web project I built using Flask — a tiny website that accepts and stores messages from users.

## Why This Project Matters

This project may be small, but it represents something big —  
I started building real things from scratch, even without traditional schooling.

I'm still learning, but I know I'm moving forward — one project at a time.

## About Me

I'm learning programming on my own, starting from zero, with the dream of becoming a real developer — not just by title, but by skill.

If you're someone who works in tech, education, or you're just curious — feel free to explore this project or give feedback. I'd love to connect.

Thanks for reading.
