# My First Flask Website

Hi! I'm a self-taught developer who left school in 8th grade and started learning programming at home.  
This is the first web project I built using Flask — a tiny website that accepts and stores messages from users.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Render (for deployment)
- Git + GitHub

---

## How to Run It Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name
cd your-repo-name
pip install flask
python upload_web.py
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)

If you want to preview the general layout of the website, you can visit: https://flask-website-1.vercel.app/. 
Please note that this deployment is only for layout testing, so some features may not be fully functional.

## About Me

I'm learning programming on my own, starting from zero, with the dream of becoming a real developer.

Thanks for reading.
