# My First Flask Website

Hi! I'm a self-taught developer who left school in 8th grade and started learning programming at home.  
This is the first web project I built using Flask — a tiny website that accepts and stores messages from users.

---

## Features

- Homepage with navigation links
- "About" page
- A message form where users can leave their name and message
- A secret message form where uses can leave their secret message (secret messages will not show on the past messages board)
- All messages are stored on the server
- A page to view all past messages
- A page to view the latest message
- A search page to search other pages
---

## What I Learned

- How Flask works and handles routes
- How to process form data with Python
- How to read and write files
- How HTML and backend code interact
- How to deploy a live website

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Flask
- HTML
- Render (for deployment)
- Git + GitHub

---

## How to Run It Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name
cd your-repo-name
pip install flask
python upload_web.py
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)

## Why This Project Matters

This project may be small, but it represents something big —  
I started building real things from scratch, even without traditional schooling.

I'm still learning, but I know I'm moving forward — one project at a time.

---

## Future Plans

- Store messages in a real database (SQLite or Supabase)
- Let an AI model respond to messages
- Add login/signup
- Build more useful web tools with Flask and AI

## About Me

I'm learning programming on my own, starting from zero, with the dream of becoming a real developer — not just by title, but by skill.

If you're someone who works in tech, education, or you're just curious — feel free to explore this project or give feedback. I'd love to connect.

Thanks for reading.
